having +- -+ disallowed makes some sense, as does -+ +-. but why -- -+? 


we're looking for alternatives

in each row, really.


so we want
++:+- or -+ privileged in the first row
+-:++ or +-
-+:-+ or --
--:++ or +-

"the substantive analysis begins with the finding that friends in Hilltown tend to hold similar values concerning race relations and proceeds to develop a model of social process which might account for this fact"

38 "interpretations of the main text are to be tested empirically"

38 "All the members of a community have been classified"
"members of the community have been formed into pairs"  --- not "all"


really does imply a total community in which knowledge of each other is complete

they call them "contact-value"

and then: "friendship" and "absence-of-friendship"


Lazarsfeld quotes merton:		<--- note that all are temporal


"some close friendships have developed among Hilltowners having diametrically opposed racial values" (--, +-) 10%

"To say that a strong and undisputed personal attachement can safely carry the burden of even serious disagreement about certain values is very different from saying that enduring friendships often involve such disagreement." (+-, +-) 20%

"...some of the cases of close friendship between liberals and illiberals which turn up in our statistical tables will, at a later time, appear as cases of friendship between like-minded individuals, as one or the other or both revise their values in the interest of preserving the relationship" (+- ++) 30%

{
most of what is not considered is the section where people start as not friends
and the analysis implies not knowing

so it's really "contacts on a regular basis"
}


so is the procedure listing out all these phrases?



and how do they justify the equilibrium?


the whole idea of introducing chains is to posit equilibrium



49 "the formal statement of a process opens up new vistas for substantive speculation"

49 -- they bring up "satiation" that could explain ++, +-



56 -- explicitly leaves out friendship formation


58
"The formal analysis clarifies concepts by giving them operational meaning"
